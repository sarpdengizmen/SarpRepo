PI PICO INTRODUCTION
UART: Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter
SPIO: Serial Peripheral Input/Output
I2C: Inter-Integrated Circuit (Communication between microcontrollers)
^^^ These are all serial comm. protocol ^^^


GPIO: General Purpose Input/Output (A digital pin 1 or 0)
3.3 Supply voltage for the PICO

Files inside pipico:
  boot.py (Works once when powered on)
  code.py (Works when reset)
  and more...
  both can be modified to fit needs

We will use circuitpython
Programs for coding:
  Thonny
  MU

Shell:
ls /dev/ttyA*
  prints ports that are connected ***





PRECAUTIONS:
  -NEVER short GND & 5V
  -Believe in resistors: No led without resistors!
  -Keep breadbords tidy, leads jump wires as short as possible.
  -Pay attention to polarities! (Capacitor etc.)
  -When usin an external supply:
    ~Common ground
    ~Prefer regulated p.s.
    ~Keep p.s. disconnected when making changes.
    ~Try using a supply with current indicator and watch how much current is being drawn.
