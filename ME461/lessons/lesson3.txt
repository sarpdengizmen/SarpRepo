OOP:
  Immutable/ mutable properties: Nonchangable/Changable properties.
  Methods/Functions: What can an object do? What can it perform?
    May be called or can be triggered by an event.
  ?? What is an instance?
    
Python:
  if __name__ == '__main__': # Allows understanding of where the code is being run from. If name is = main the code is not imported.
  eval(): Tries to evaluate a string as a meaningful line of code. If name = main the code is not imported.
  isinstance(): Checks if an object is an instance of a class.
  dir(<class>): Prints out all the attributes and methods of a class.
    dirs with __ are hidden methods.
  Classes can be inherited from other classes.
    As an example: A student class will be a parent class. ME461 Student can inherit properties of sudents and modify them according to needs. (INHERITANCE)
    Even every custom function has a parent class. (Backhand of python)
