Search Algorithms:
  Greedy search: With feedack infromation from target, algorithms makes instant decisions that get closer to target without regard to correct path.
  Blind search: Without feedback infromation trying to reach target.

  Successor function (operator): returns a set of reachable states with a single action.
  Cost functions 
  (Huiristic): Not unique, estimate of cost of reaching goal. Cost of greedy.
  g(n): Cost of path to current point in algorithm. A cost function of blind search.

  Huiristic + g(n): Blind + Greedy A**


  The search process builds a search tree, with the root being the initial state.
