OOP:
  Immutable/ mutable properties: Nonchangable/Changable properties.
  Methods/Functions: What can an object do? What can it perform?
    May be called or can be triggered by an event.
    
Python:
  if __name__ == '__main__': # Allows understanding of where the code is being run from. If name is = main the code is not imported.
  eval(): Tries to evaluate a string as a meaningful line of code. If name = main the code is not imported.
