Image Processing A Basic Introduction for Mechatronics Applictions

An image in computers corresponds to tensors, stacked up matrices
  Black and white images are 2D matrices
  Color images are 3D matrices (RGB)

In images sampling corresponds to pixel resolution
Quantization is the number of bits used to represent each pixel (Its color representation quality)

Check the collab file that introduces numpy.

Definitions for images:
  -Neighbors: 4 neighbors (+) or 8 neighbors (+ and x)
  -Path: A sequence of pixels such that pixels are neighbors, can be 4-path or 8-path
  -Foreground: The object of interest in the image (pixels denoted 1)
  -Background: The rest of the image (pixels denoted 0)
  -Connectivity: A pixel p is connected to pixel q in foreground if there is a path between them. (Not leaving the foreground)
  -Boundary: The set of pixels that are connected to the background and the foreground (8 connected)
  -Interior: The set of pixels that are connected to the foreground and not the background (4 connnected)
  Properties:
    -Size
    -Area, Perimeter
    -Position (First moment minimized)
    -Orientaion (Second moment minimized)
    -Elongation
    -Compactness (Perimiter**2/Area) (Circle is most compact 4*pi) 
    -Euler Number (Number of component - Number of Holes) (Indifferent to scaling rotation etc.)
    -Distance: Euclidian, City Block, Chessboard (Maximum of Chessboard)
    -Medial Axis: ????
    -Projections: Stacking to x or y axis. Can be used for understandign similarity of objects.
    
  Actions:
    -Translation
    -Reflection: Mirroring w.r.t origin
    -Erosion & Dilation: Expansion and shrinking from the boundary.
      Using erosion and then dilation can be used as a size filter depending on size of structuring element. Eliminate noise on background. OPENING 
    -Dilation & Erosion: Eliminate noise on foreground. CLOSING
